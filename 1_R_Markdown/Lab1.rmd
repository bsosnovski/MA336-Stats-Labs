Use this template rmd file to submit your answers for the Lab assigment. Update the YAML above to have your name and current date.


# Lab exercise (50 points) 

In general, the lab component of the assignments will be some coding task(s) using R. Most of the time, the expectation is that students `copy` and `paste` R chunks of code from the lab instructions, then make some adjustments to that code to achieve the result required for the exercises.

Peform the following taks.

1. Write an R code that will compute the number 10. (10 pts)

`Enter your code below:`



2. Write the equation for the Pythagora's theorem: **The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs**
(10 pts)

`Enter your code below:`



3. Create a R Markdow file (a completely separate file from this) that contains the following content (30 pts):

* a YAML header with an appropriate title, your name, and date
* a chunck of code of any type you want
* load a package (try to Google package names to use in this part)
* some text with formatting
