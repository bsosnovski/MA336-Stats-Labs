# Introduction to R Markdown

This lab will show you how to write an R Markdown document.

## General Goals

In this lab, you will learn the following:

1. What R Markdown is
2. How to create an R Markdown file
2. How to use the most common R Markdown syntax
4. How to add code in your R Markdown file
5. How to format your text and equations in R Markdown

## Lab templates

You will complete each lab and writing assignment (WA) by writing your code and notes in the corresponding R Markdown document. 

For example, for lab 1, open the answer template Rmd file called **Lab_1.rmd** in your project's directory for lab 1. Use it to add your code and notes for the lab. For WA 1, open the answer template Rmd file called **WA_1.rmd** in the same folder in your directory.

## Markdown

Markdown is a way of adding to a plain text document formatting, such as headers, lists, emphasis, quotes, links to URLs and images, and more.

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to HTML.

## R Markdown

R Markdown allows you to write HTML, PDF, and/or MS Word documents, a presentation, or even a book using Markdown syntax and embedded programming code.

R Markdown files have extension **.Rmd**

The "**R**" in R Markdown stands for the [R statistical computing](https://www.R-project.org/) language.

R Markdown files contain three essential types of content:

1. An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.
2. Chunks of R code surrounded by ```.
3. Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

We will cover these contents in this lab.




## Creating Rmd Files (Cocalc.com)

To create an Rmd file in Cocalc. com, go to your project's directory (location) where you want the file to be. Then:

1. Click on "New"
2. Choose the option "RMarkdown (.rmd)" 
3. The system will prompt you to enter a name for the file (optional)
4. Click "Create"

### Example

Create an Rmd file named "My_File" in the same directory where this lab is located.




## Load Packages

Packages are collections of R functions, data, and some compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library. R comes with a standard set of packages.  Others packages are available for download and must be installed. 

In Cocalc, many packages are already installed, so there is no need to install them.

Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into the session to be used.

To load a package in R, we invoke the command ``library(package)`` where in ''package'' will be replaced with the name of the package you want to load.

Here is an example of how to invoke a package in R Markdown.

```{r}
library("knitr")
```

**Note:** To run any R chunk of code, you must use the 3 backticks followed by R in curly braces, and after the code you want to run, close the chunk with another set of 3 backticks. More on this later in this lab.

The ``knitr`` package extends the basic markdown syntax to include chunks of executable R code.

Cocalc already has this package loaded for you. But if you are running your code, say in R Studio on your computer, you would need to install and include the ``knitr`` in the library of your document or script.


### Example

Now load the package called ``dplyr``.

`Enter your code below:`




**Note:** You will learn how to install packages for R in Cocalc in lab 2 (Stay tuned.).




## Formatting text

I hope you already noticed some of the formatted text above in this rmd file.

Here is some basic formatting of text in Markdown.

### Comments

You can add comments in Markdown documents as follows: ``<!-- your comment -->``. The comments will not be displayed in any output format.

<span style='color:#d2691e'>Compare this line here in the rmd file (on the left in Cocalc.com) and the output format in HTML on the right (Note that the comment below is missing!!.</span>

<!--  This will not be displayed in the output format -->

### Plain Code Blocks

Plain code blocks are displayed in a fixed-width font but not evaluated by R.

```
2*3
This text is displayed verbatim.
```
You will see this throughout this rmd file to display examples of codes that are not evaluated.


### Headers
   
   You can include section headers by using pound signs.
   

```
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header
```

### Emphasis


```
*italic*   **bold**

_italic_   __bold__

```
Note that the word *Statistics* is italic here, and the word **markdown** is bold.

Here is an example: *Bianca* **Sosnovski**

### Example

Write your full name in both italic and bold font.

`Enter your answer below:`



  
### Lists

##### Unordered list

* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b

The code for the list above is:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
    
```


##### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b


The code for the list above is:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
```

### Example

Create a list of textbooks you will need to buy and/or download for free for your classes this semester.

`Enter your code below:`





### Hyperlinks

To add hyperlinks, we surround the links with brackets and then provide the link address in parentheses, like this [QCC](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu).

```
[QCC](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu)
```

## Embedding R code


As you see at the beginning of this lab, you can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
#cars is a built-in data set in R
```

Note that the line preceded by `#` is a comment in the R code and that you can add comments in the R code chunk with a pound sign. 


### Example

Enter an R code chunk that produces, as a result, the number 6.

`Enter your code below:`



To add an inline code, use a pair of single backticks and the letter r. For example, `r 2*3` (compare this with the Rmd file). We can also mark text as inline code using a pair of backticks. For example, `code`.

You can also embed plots in your rmd files. For example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

You can do many things in a code chunk: produce text output, tables, or graphics. You have complete control over all these outputs via chunk options, which can be provided inside the curly braces (between `{r and }`).

**Note:** the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot (if applicable).

### Example
Create a code chunk to produce the dataset `Seatbelts` summary.

`Enter your code below:`


### Example
Create a code chunk to plot the dataset `Seatbelts`.

`Enter your code below:`



## Writing mathematical equations and formulas

Of course, you can include math formulas using dollar signs around the equation in Latex syntax (Using $ symbols around the equation).

The following is the code for writing the equation of the area of a circle in two formats.

### In line

```
$ A= \pi r^2 $
``` 

### In equation display

```
$$ A= \pi r^2 $$ 
```

### Example

Write the equation of the circumference of a circle. 

`Enter your code below:`
