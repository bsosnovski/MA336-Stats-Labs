# Lab exercise (50 points) 


1. Install the R package `abbreviate`  in the Home directory in your project.


    The package `abbreviate` can be found here: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abbreviate/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abbreviate/index.html)


2. Below is part of a code chunk that uses the library you just installed. Complete the code and run it. The result will be an abbreviation of the words in the variable `txt`.

```
txt <- c("statistics", "mathematics", "programming", "maximum", "average")
abbreviate_text(txt,3)
```

**Note:** If you installed the package successfully and completed the code above correctly, it will run without issues (no error messages!).
